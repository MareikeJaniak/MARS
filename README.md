MARS is a tool for multiple circular sequence alignment. To compile MARS, please follow the instructions given in file INSTALL.

INPUT: A set of sequences in FASTA format. The input file is specified using the -i option. 

OUTPUT: The set of refined (via cyclic shifts) sequences with no gaps added in FASTA format. The output file is specified using the -o option. 
This output file can then be used as input of the preferred MSA program to obtain the final alignment.
